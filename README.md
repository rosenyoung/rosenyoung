### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Master of Commerce and future PhD in Finance Student at Monash University. My research interests include topics about mutual funds, asset pricing, and corporate governance. I am now working on a topic about how target date funds influence CEO incentives.

I would like to share my codes once I finish each of my research projects.

I was quite interested in trading but now I focus more on academic research. 

You can reach me at ryan0055@student.monash.edu
